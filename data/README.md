# Data Directory

This directory holds workflow state and shared data. All content here is **starter state** for the template—no personal or project-specific data.

- **shared/workflow_state.json** – Current workflow state. Starts as `idle` with no workflow running.
- **shared/architecture.md** – Overwritten by Code Architect when you run a workflow. Placeholder until then.
- **knowledge_base/** – Lessons, mistakes, standards, and performance tips. Starts empty of entries; agents add to it as projects complete.
- **templates/** – Optional reusable templates (code or doc snippets).

Do not commit personal project names, workflow IDs from your runs, or sensitive data to this directory.
